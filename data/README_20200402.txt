Data Description:	Linearly interpolated mean total growing season ET, 2014-2019 (Landsat-8 METRIC EEFlux, original resolution 28.5 m, see below), ASTER-30 m digital elevation data (original resolution 30 m), and slope data calculated from DEM (2 km moving window) extracted over pixels down the stream channel of the San Pedro River, Arizona, between the US-Mexico Border and Benson Arizona.  Total length-scale of the data represented is 97 km.  Data were resampled to equal intervals at a 250 m distance scale (0.25 km).

Wide-format dataset (SPR_TotET6yrmean_elev_wide.csv)
Fields:
Distance_km:	Distance from transect start.  Begins 1.25 km, ends 96 km.
Elev_m:		Elevation in meters
TotET_mm:	Mean total growing season evapotranspiration in mm, years 2014-2019.  Growing season is Mar-Oct.
slope_pct:	Percent slope calculated at a 2-km moving window, integrating over 9 observations at 0.25 km scale.

Long-format dataset (SPR_TotET6yrmean_elev_long.csv)
Fields:
Distance_km:	Distance from transect start.  Begins 1.25 km, ends 96 km.
variable:	Variable type.  Includes Elev_m, TotET_mm, and slope_pct as described above.
value:		Value of variable types.
